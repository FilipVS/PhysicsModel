Goal
	This project aims to create a simulator that shows the movement of a charged particle in an electric field.
Platform
	The simulator is being developed using C# and WPF and is thus aimed at Windows operating system.
Controls
	The simulator is controlled as standard desktop application.
Status
	This is the first usable version, but many features (updating position, changing properties on different charges...) are still missing.
